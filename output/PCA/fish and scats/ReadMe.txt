We standardised per type (i.e. fish or scat) only for classical PCA, so classical PCA are on relative compositions and not the other ones. 
We can't do it the same way for the other ones (coda methods) because the standardisation results in negative values that can't be ilr transformed afterwards. So I don't know how to do it...
